          <p>Hello there! I am having some troubles with R, so please accept this alternative to the assignment, thanks!
             It's a Jupiter Notebook in R from Kaggle, share through Jovian and publish in Github.
             And the output is hosted in Google Drive... It's crazy, I know.

             <p>The input is this

              And the output is
